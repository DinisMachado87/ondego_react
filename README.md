## Design

### Font Selection

Öndëgö's font selection embodies a delicate balance between friendliness and authenticity, without straying into gimmickry. Each font choice contributes to the project's visual identity by infusing warmth and approachability into the design, while also maintaining a sense of genuine connection. Through Platypi, Mukta, and Padauk, Öndëgö aims to create an inviting and inclusive atmosphere where spontaneity thrives, fostering meaningful interactions among friends without resorting to artificiality or clichés.

## Primary Font: Platypi

**Platypi** was carefully chosen as the primary font for Öndëgö's branding and logo. Its playful and quirky appearance perfectly embodies the project's relaxed and informal vibe, injecting personality without veering into formality. With rounded shapes and a whimsical charm, Platypi sets the tone for Öndëgö's unique identity as a platform for spontaneous hangout activities among friends.

## Secondary Font: Mukta

**Mukta** serves as the secondary font, utilized for titles and navigation elements across Öndëgö. Balancing casualness with clarity, Mukta adds depth to the visual hierarchy while maintaining coherence with Platypi's playful demeanor. Its versatility complements the project's laid-back aesthetic, ensuring a cohesive and enjoyable user experience.

## Tertiary Font: Padauk

For body text and content, **Padauk** was selected as the tertiary font. Its light and airy design prioritizes readability and simplicity, allowing the focus to remain on the content while providing a comfortable reading experience. Padauk seamlessly integrates with the playful energy of Platypi and the relaxed tone of Mukta, completing Öndëgö's font palette.
