## Design

### Establishing **Öndëgö**'s Visual Identity

As Öndëgö took shape, I envisioned a design that harmonized playfulness with sobriety, evoking a sense of intrigue and vibrancy. The app's interface features backgrounds in variations of black and very dark grey, lending an eerie yet captivating ambiance. Against this backdrop, fonts in secondary vibrant colors — orange, purple, and green — punctuate the darkness with neon vibes, striking a balance between whimsy and sophistication.

### Logo

In the journey of shaping Öndëgö's visual identity and its logo, I turned to the playful and quirky Platypi font from Google Fonts. With the help of the Google Fonts to SVG Path online tool, I transformed the text outline into a vector graphic (SVG) to give Öndëgö its unique mark.

The process began with selecting Platypi, a playful and quirky Google Font, to reflect Öndëgö's essence. I crafted the outline of the app's name using the Platypi font. The rounded shapes and whimsical charm of Platypi perfectly encapsulated the spirit of Öndëgö, setting the foundation for its visual identity.

To transform the Platypi text into a scalable vector graphic (SVG), I turned to [Google Font to SVG Path](https://danmarshall.github.io/google-font-to-svg-path/), a tool capable of converting text to SVG paths. I then captured the SVG vectors as a design feature.

Next, using [Canva](https://www.canva.com/), I converted the file to a PNG with a transparent background.

Overall, your version effectively communicates your process. These suggestions are merely to enhance clarity and readability. Great work!

### Font Selection

Öndëgö's font selection embodies a delicate balance between friendliness and authenticity, without straying into gimmickry. Each font choice contributes to the project's visual identity by infusing warmth and approachability into the design, while also maintaining a sense of genuine connection. Through Platypi, Mukta, and Padauk, Öndëgö aims to create an inviting and inclusive atmosphere where spontaneity thrives, fostering meaningful interactions among friends without resorting to artificiality or clichés.

## Primary Font: Platypi

**Platypi** was carefully chosen as the primary font for Öndëgö's branding and logo. Its playful and quirky appearance perfectly embodies the project's relaxed and informal vibe, injecting personality without veering into formality. With rounded shapes and a whimsical charm, Platypi sets the tone for Öndëgö's unique identity as a platform for spontaneous hangout activities among friends.

## Secondary Font: Mukta

**Mukta** serves as the secondary font, utilized for titles and navigation elements across Öndëgö. Balancing casualness with clarity, Mukta adds depth to the visual hierarchy while maintaining coherence with Platypi's playful demeanor. Its versatility complements the project's laid-back aesthetic, ensuring a cohesive and enjoyable user experience.

## Tertiary Font: Padauk

For body text and content, **Padauk** was selected as the tertiary font. Its light and airy design prioritizes readability and simplicity, allowing the focus to remain on the content while providing a comfortable reading experience. Padauk seamlessly integrates with the playful energy of Platypi and the relaxed tone of Mukta, completing Öndëgö's font palette.
